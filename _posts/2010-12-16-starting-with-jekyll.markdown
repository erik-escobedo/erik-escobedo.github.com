title: Starting with Jekyll
---

When I first thought about creating a personal site, I was thinking about using
it as a kind of dynamic *resum√©*. So, I just needed a few `HTML` pages for
writing down my CV and contact data. Also, it sounded like a good idea to
upload that site as a [github page][1] and use it as a
customed home page for [my github profile][2]. That was good and easy, until I
wanted to have a blog too.

The problem with the blog is than I didn't want go through all the trouble about
getting a hosting and setting up an entire CMS for something as simple as a blog.
I just wanted a place in my personal site where I could write stuff related to
my careers' day-to-day evolution. That's all.

So I googled a little, read a lot and found `Jekyll` is the perfect system for
accomplish my goals (seriously, it was even [*designed*][3] for that).

Hence, I write this first post with two intentions: testing all this jekyll stuff
and sharing [this great starting guide][guide], written by the guys in [Envy Labs][envy].
